# Stop-the-Burn
A super small WoW addon to block a certain EU server in tradechat because they just won't speak english

Put the entire "Stop the Burn" folder in your addons directory and restart wow.
It will block everything in general/trade where the playername ends in "-BurningLegion".

You can also edit the file core.lua to include blocking of whispers and yells.
